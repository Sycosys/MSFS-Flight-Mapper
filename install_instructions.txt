MSFS LANDING INSPECTOR

1. ABOUT

MSFS Landing Inspector is a tool for analyzing landings in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. It reads the airplaneâ€™s telemetry data via SimConnect and displays relevant information about your landing in a web browser. The MSFS Landing Inspector is free to use.

MSFS Landing Inspector displays the following data:

- Current vertical G force
- Current vertical speed
- Touchdown G force
- Touchdown vertical speed
- Graph showing the G forces during landing
- Graph showing the vertical speed during landing
- Graph showing the altitude above ground during landing

Update Version 1.1:

- Fixed -999999 values caused by low frame rates.
- Fixed vertical speed to represent true values instead of indicated.
- Landing rating is now based on the vertical speed at touchdown.
- Improved visualization of charts. Different colors are now shown for data when airborne and when on the ground.

Thanks to the community for your great support!
